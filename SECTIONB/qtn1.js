// Q1. What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

// Answer:

// let is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block where it is declared.
// let is hoisted, but unlike var
// You can reassign a value to a variable declared with let.

// var: Function-scoped unlike let and const
// can be reassigned
// and hoisted with initialization.
// It is used for variables that can change.

// const:
//  Block-scoped unlike var
// cannot be reassigned unlike let and var
// hoisted but not initialized. 
// It is used for constants.
